# "Dear (My Tinder) Data" 

This project was done in the context of a class assignment for _SOCI 280: Data & Society_. The "Dear (My) Data" project is about personal data collection, aiming to deepen understanding of data and its role in society. It's divided into four parts:

- **Data Collection:** Collect data about a regular aspect of your life.
- **Physical Visualization:** Create a tangible representation of your data.
- **Digital Visualization:** Re-create the data visually using a digital tool.
- **Write-Up:** Reflect on the data and its impact, including the broader context.

I decided to work with my Tinder Data. You can find the analysis on the Notion page below:
